An attempt to shift my consumption vs. creation ratio to something a bit more healthy.  Goal of writing things here is to 1) force some level of understanding about the world, 2) get better at expressing myself, and 3) why not.

Ultimately would like for this to be less of a "series of random blog posts" and have sections for different ideas/concepts that evolve over time - more of a Wikipedia of my mind than a Twitter of my thoughts.  But one step at a time!
