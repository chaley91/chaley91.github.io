An attempt to shift my balance of consumption/digestion/creation to something a bit more healthy.  Goal of writing things here is to 1) force some level of understanding about the world, 2) get better at expressing myself, and 3) I don't need to have reasons/goals for it, I guess.

Ultimately would like for this to be less of a "series of random blog posts" and have sections for different ideas/concepts that evolve over time - more of a Wikipedia of my mind than a Twitter of my thoughts.  But one step at a time, so I don't trip over my hubris.
